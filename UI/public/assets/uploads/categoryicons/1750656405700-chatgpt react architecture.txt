React Project Architecture
A React project is a collection of multiple folders and files which together form the entire application. Below is a breakdown of the main components:

1. package.json
This is the application configuration file.

It includes:

App version

Scripts for running/testing the app

List of dependencies

Other project metadata

2. package-lock.json
This file stores a detailed list of all installed sub-packages.

It ensures consistent installs across environments.

It is an auto-generated file when npm install is run.

3. index.html
This is the main HTML file used in a Single Page Application (SPA).

React uses this file to load the entire app inside a single page.

It is the first page loaded when the app runs.

4. src/ (Source Folder)
Contains the main application source code.

Includes static data, components, configuration files, and more.

Contents of src/:
index.jsx:

The main entry point.

Responsible for rendering the React app into the real DOM.

Connects the virtual DOM with the real DOM using ReactDOM.render().

App.jsx:

The root (parent) component of the application.

All custom child components are linked through App.

App.css:

Styling specific to the App component.

index.css:

Global CSS file used throughout the application.

assets/:

Stores all static resources like images, audio, video, icons, etc.
